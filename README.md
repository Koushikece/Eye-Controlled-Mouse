# Eye-Controlled-Mouse
Here I have made an Eye_Controlled_Mouse using python , which you can control your mouse using the movement of your head and you can Imitate the Mouse Click by blinking your Eyes...

Modules I have used are-

**Cv2** -: *OpenCV module*

**MediaPipe** -: *MediaPipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video, audio*.

**PyAutoGui** -: *PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications*.

it will open a webcam as soon as i will run the code . That webcam can also run in the minimise window so we can perform all the tasks which we want to .
